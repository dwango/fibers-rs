//! This is a library to execute a number of lightweight asynchronous tasks (a.k.a, fibers).
//!
//! Note that `fibers` heavily uses [futures][futures] to
//! represent asynchronous task. If you are not familiar with it,
//! we recommend that you refer the `README.md` and `TUTORIAL.md` of [futures][futures]
//! before reading the following.
//!
//! This library also uses [mio](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) to achieve
//! efficient asynchronous I/O handling (mainly for networking primitives).
//! However, its existence is hidden from the user, so you do not usually have to worry about it.
//!
//! [futures]: https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs
//!
//! ---
//!
//! `Future` is an excellent way to represent asynchronous task.
//! It is intuitive, easily composed with other futures to represent a complicated task,
//! without runtime overhead.
//! But, there is a remaining problem that
//! "How to efficiently execute (possibility a very large amount of) concurrent tasks?".
//! `fibers` is an answer to the problem.
//!
//! Conceptually, the responsibility of `fibers` is very simple.
//! It represents an asynchronous task (a.k.a., fiber) as a future instance.
//! And there is an executor that takes futures and executes them like following.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Creates an executor.
//! let mut executor = ThreadPoolExecutor::new().unwrap();
//!
//! // Spawns fibers (i.e., passes futures to the executor).
//! executor.spawn(futures::lazy(|| { println!("Hello"); Ok(())} ));
//! executor.spawn(futures::lazy(|| { println!("World!"); Ok(())} ));
//!
//! // Executes them.
//! executor.run().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Fibers may be run on different background threads, but the user does not need to notice it.
//! If it runs on machines with a large number of processors, performance will improve naturally.
//!
//! Roughly speaking, if a future returns `Async::NotReady` response to
//! a call of `Future::poll` method,
//! the fiber associated with the future will move into the "waiting" state.
//! Then, it is suspended (descheduled) until any event in which the future is interested happens
//! (e.g., waits until data is arrived on a target TCP socket).
//! Finally, if a future returns `Async::Ready` response,
//! the fiber will be regarded as completed and the executor will drop the fiber.
//!
//! This library provides primitives for writing programs in an efficient
//! asynchronous fashion (See documentations of [net](net/index.html),
//! [sync](sync/index.html), [io](io/index.html), [time](time/index.html) modules for more details).
//!
//! The main concern of this library is "how to execute fibers".
//! So it is preferred to use external crates (e.g., [`handy_async`][handy_async])
//! to describe "how to represent asynchronous tasks".
//!
//! [handy_async]: https://github.com/sile/handy_async
//!
//! Examples
//! ========
//!
//! The following are examples of writing code to perform asynchronous tasks.
//!
//! Other examples are found in "fibers/examples" directory.
//! And you can run an example by executing the following command.
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo run --example ${EXAMPLE_NAME}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Calculation of fibonacci numbers
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate fibers;
//! # extern crate futures;
//! use fibers::{Spawn, Executor, ThreadPoolExecutor};
//! use futures::Future;
//!
//! fn fibonacci<H: Spawn + Clone>(n: usize, handle: H) -> Box<dyn Future<Item=usize, Error=()> + Send> {
//!     if n < 2 {
//!         Box::new(futures::finished(n))
//!     } else {
//!         // Spawns a new fiber per recursive call.
//!         let f0 = handle.spawn_monitor(fibonacci(n - 1, handle.clone()));
//!         let f1 = handle.spawn_monitor(fibonacci(n - 2, handle.clone()));
//!         Box::new(f0.join(f1).map(|(a0, a1)| a0 + a1).map_err(|_| ()))
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Creates an executor instance.
//! let mut executor = ThreadPoolExecutor::new().unwrap();
//!
//! // Creates a future which will calculate the fibonacchi number of `10`.
//! let input_number = 10;
//! let future = fibonacci(input_number, executor.handle());
//!
//! // Spawns and executes the future (fiber).
//! let monitor = executor.spawn_monitor(future);
//! let answer = executor.run_fiber(monitor).unwrap();
//!
//! // Checkes the answer.
//! assert_eq!(answer, Ok(55));
//! ```
//!
//! ### TCP Echo Server
//!
//! An example of TCP echo server listening at the address "127.0.0.1:3000":
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # extern crate fibers;
//! # extern crate futures;
//! # extern crate handy_async;
//! use std::io;
//! use fibers::{Spawn, Executor, ThreadPoolExecutor};
//! use fibers::net::TcpListener;
//! use futures::{Future, Stream};
//! use handy_async::io::{AsyncWrite, ReadFrom};
//! use handy_async::pattern::AllowPartial;
//!
//! let server_addr = "127.0.0.1:3000".parse().expect("Invalid TCP bind address");
//!
//! let mut executor = ThreadPoolExecutor::new().expect("Cannot create Executor");
//! let handle0 = executor.handle();
//! let monitor = executor.spawn_monitor(TcpListener::bind(server_addr)
//!     .and_then(move |listener| {
//!         println!("# Start listening: {}: ", server_addr);
//!
//!         // Creates a stream of incoming TCP client sockets
//!         listener.incoming().for_each(move |(client, addr)| {
//!             // New client is connected.
//!             println!("# CONNECTED: {}", addr);
//!             let handle1 = handle0.clone();
//!
//!             // Spawns a fiber to handle the client.
//!             handle0.spawn(client.and_then(move |client| {
//!                     // For simplicity, splits reading process and
//!                     // writing process into differrent fibers.
//!                     let (reader, writer) = (client.clone(), client);
//!                     let (tx, rx) = fibers::sync::mpsc::channel();
//!
//!                     // Spawns a fiber for the writer side.
//!                     // When a message is arrived in `rx`,
//!                     // this fiber sends it back to the client.
//!                     handle1.spawn(rx.map_err(|_| -> io::Error { unreachable!() })
//!                         .fold(writer, |writer, buf: Vec<u8>| {

//!                     let stream = vec![0;1024].allow_partial().into_stream(reader);
//!                     stream.map_err(|e| e.into_error())
//!                         .fold(tx, |tx, (mut buf, len)| {
//!                             buf.truncate(len);
//!                             println!("# RECV: {} bytes", buf.len());
//!
//!                             // Sends received  to the writer half.
//!                             tx.send(buf).expect("Cannot send");
